Requires at least: 2.2.0
Stable tag: Trunk

This plugin will give you the ability to add generalized headers & footer HTML
to all the pages in your blog.

Note: The headers are added between the <HEAD> and </HEAD> tags, so they
cannot be used to add text to the page.  It's intended to allow you to add
meta data to the pages.  

The footer entry is inserted into your blog just before the </BODY> tag, 
as long as the theme you are using uses the correct Wordpress function
calls.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the full directory into your wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate it in the Plugin options

(pretty simple, eh?)

Use the options page to set the header & footers you want to use.

NOTE: The headers & footers can be any arbitrary HTML (javascript included)
so be very careful with what you set the values to.
